## Release build secrets

The release workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) reads these GitHub
Actions secrets:

- `TAURI_PRIVATE_KEY`, `TAURI_KEY_PASSWORD` — updater signing key.
- `ARKIVET_LOKI_URL`, `ARKIVET_LOKI_USER`, `ARKIVET_LOKI_PASSWORD` — Loki log
  shipping. They are baked into the binary at build time
  (`src-tauri/src/services/loki_shipper.rs`). The same names set as runtime
  environment variables override the baked values. If any one is missing,
  log shipping stays off and the app logs one line saying so. Use a push-only
  Loki user: anyone with the binary can extract it.

Failed Tauri commands are reported to the log (and so to Loki) with the
command name, error message and duration only, never their arguments
(`src/services/invoke.ts`).

## Webview security

`src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` sets a strict CSP (scripts only from the app,
inline styles allowed for antd), turns off `withGlobalTauri`, and narrows the
allowlist to what the frontend uses. Detect Tauri with `src/utils/isTauri.ts`,
not `window.__TAURI__`. The e2e-fullstack build turns the global back on with
`TAURI_CONFIG='{"build":{"withGlobalTauri":true}}'` (see
`.github/workflows/e2e-windows.yml`), because its specs drive the app through it.
